      <h1>About Red Panda Gifts</h1>
      <p>Born out of a love of making hand made gifts, I decided it was time I spread the joy!</p>
      <p>I am a stay at home mum of a 4 year old and a soon to be 2 year old so my life is pretty hectic but I needed something to keep the mind sharp (and the paw patrol theme tune out of my head) so thought I would make what I love doing on a bigger scale. I have enjoyed making frames for friends and family over the years and with a recent move/baby/work the opportunity came around for me to finally get it up and running!</p>
      <p>I really do hope you enjoy the frames as much as I do and keep checking for more exciting lines coming soon!! Lots of new ideas coming over the summer and hopefully some different gift ideas for mums and babies too!</p>
      <p>Please feel free to contact me and chat about what occasion you would like a frame for and we can chat over the options and make a wonderful present for you.</p>
